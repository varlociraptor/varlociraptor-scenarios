name: Complex pedigree calling with priors
desc: |
  This scenario configures Varlociraptor to perform a complex pedigree calling. The model is configured with prior assumptions about mutation rate and heterozygosity.

  Note the reuse of the two denovo events in negated form as expressions in the `other` event. 
  Since the event space in Varlociraptor needs to cover all possibilites (absent event is always implicitly added), such statements can be very handy.
  When performing such a negation, it is important to also include the absent event though (to avoid considering it twice).
