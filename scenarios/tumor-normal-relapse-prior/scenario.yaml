    # While in general one could set the true prior expectation for somatic variants
    # in healthy tissue below (e.g. 1e-10), it is usually advisable to
    # put the same rate as for the tumor below. Otherwise,
    # it can happen that evidence for the mutation being already in the normal
    # is put aside just because the prior probability is so much lower
    # than in the tumor. Since usually one is interested in true somatic
    # mutations, this approach can be considered conservative in the sense that
    # at most some borderline cases could be lost when filtering for somatic variants
    # in the tumor.
